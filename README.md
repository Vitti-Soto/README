Through my education at the University of Florida, I've worked extensively on game design projects,
database management, and networking/operating systems. My focus has been game design and development!

You can check through the repositories of some of the projects I was involved in, in which the majority
of my responsibilities were often data storage and access, interactions between the user/player and the AI,
and API access. 

I'm currently studying through Stephen Ulibarri's Gameplay Ability System UE5 course!
