Through my education at the University of Florida, I've worked extensively on game design projects,
database management, and networking/operating systems through ethical hacking!

You can check through the repositories of some of the projects I was involved in, in which the majority
of my responsibilities were often data storage and access, interactions between the user/player and the AI,
and API access.
