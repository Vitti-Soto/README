- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victor A. Sotomayor!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, game development, and artificial intelligence!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning game development through Unreal Engine 4/5 by working on my own personal project alongside my brother.

Through my education at the University of Florida, I've worked extensively on game design projects,
and have some experience with database management, and UX. My focus has been game design and development!

You can check through the repositories of some of the projects I was involved in, in which the majority
of my responsibilities were often data storage and access, interactions between the user/player and the AI,
and API access. 

I've taken several of Stephen Ulibarri's Unreal Engine courses and am confident in my ability to work on my own game!
